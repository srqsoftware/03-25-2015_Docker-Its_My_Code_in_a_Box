"Docker - Its My Code in a Box" presentation by Tim Crowley on March 25th, 2015 at SSEUG meeting.

Meeting agenda: http://srqsoftware.github.io/03-25-2015_Docker-Its_My_Code_in_a_Box/

A presentation on how Docker may revolutionize the way we develop and deploy software

# Abstract
Docker technology provides a consistent and transportable approach for building, deploying, and running software in the cloud. Docker's standardized containers can be deployed in different vendor environments in a consistent way. The containers allow the developer and the administrator to focus on best practices, instead of environment-specific dependencies. In many ways, it's become a "build once, deploy anywhere" solution for the cloud.

During this presentation, Tim will build a simple web application, and then mix and match databases and cloud environments. Across all platforms, the development and deployment processes will be remarkably similar.
